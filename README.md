# Test Assignments

This repository contains solutions to various test assignments and coding challenges. Each assignment is organized in its own subdirectory, implemented as a UV (Poetry-based) Python project. The goal is to practice and showcase problem-solving skills across different domains.

## Structure

- `test-assignments/`: Root directory of the repository.
  - `<assignment_name>/`: Subdirectory for each specific assignment.

## Example Assignment

- **Avito-tech**: A Python library that fetches a square matrix from a remote server and returns its counter-clockwise spiral traversal.
